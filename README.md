# Carbon Footprint Calculator
An iOS application built using data from the EPA's carbon footprint calculator (https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/), Swift, and Google Firebase.
Originally planned as an introduction to coding for non-computer science majors in Michigan Eco Data (a University of Michigan environmental club).
